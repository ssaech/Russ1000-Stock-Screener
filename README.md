# Russ1000-Stock-Screener
Screening all stocks in the Russell 1000 index to identify which stocks are likely to have a large move soon. This tool has been tremendously helpful in my options investment strategies. 


All stocks that pass a custom algorithm that targets stocks that are in an overall uptrend but are recovering from a recent price drop. 
Top graph contains one year of daily stock closes, exponential moving averages, Bollinger bands and ATR ranges.
Middle graph contains a price-momentum swing technique.
Bottom graph contains volume.
